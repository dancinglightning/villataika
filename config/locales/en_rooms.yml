        Welcome to the charming and peaceful Villa Taika! <br/>
        We have created a unique B&amp;B, with 8 individually decorated rooms.
        Inspired by our trips to the Orient , we brought that beauty and inspiration with us in the
        pieces of furniture, that we selected to our rooms. <br/>
        We hope you will be revitalised and rested in the beauty of our surroundings! <br/>

        In the backyard we have a garden with the pond and waterfall.
        You can relax in the garden by listening to the soothing sound of the water or make trips to the
        nearby tourist sights.
